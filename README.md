#  DuiTogether

## Abstract
People always have a hard time forming or fighting a habit, but it will be easier when you are not alone, when people who want to do the same thing can check on you everyday. DuiTogether empowers users to form a group, when fighting bad habits or pursuing new habits. Here users will receive the support and supervision from their peers after setting a specific goal, thus have a better chance finishing it.

## Target users
People who wants to start new habits/fight bad habits. For example, people who want to work out every day, going to classes, stop procrastination or finishing a few Leetcode problems are all good potential users for the app.

## Current Directions
- Create customization for LeetCode progress tracking.
- Localization for the Chinese market.
